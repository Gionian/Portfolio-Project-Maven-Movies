# Maven Movies Data Analysis Project

## Overview
In this project, I worked as a data analyst for Maven Movies, a DVD rental business, to deliver crucial insights using SQL. Leveraging MySQL, I analyzed various aspects of the business, including customer activity, inventory management, and revenue trends. This project involved extensive use of SQL querying techniques, data exploration, and relational data analysis, providing valuable insights to guide business decisions.

## Project Objectives
The key objectives of this project were to:
- Develop familiarity with Maven Movies' database, containing 16 tables with details on transactions, customers, inventory, and staff.
- Use SQL to analyze data on sales, inventory, customer behavior, and staff performance.
- Provide insights for strategic planning and operational improvements.

## Scope and Key Tasks

### Database Exploration
I first explored the database structure and relationships across multiple tables, identifying key tables for customers, rentals, payments, inventory, and staff.

### Customer Behavior Analysis
I performed detailed analysis on customer rental habits, identifying high-frequency customers and analyzing rental patterns to suggest improvements in customer engagement.

### Inventory and Sales Analysis
By analyzing the inventory data, I assessed the rental rates, average rental duration, and inventory turnover, which provided insights into popular items and optimal stock levels.

### Staff Performance and Payment Analysis
I examined employee transaction data and conducted payment trend analysis to understand average payments, detect anomalies, and suggest controls for minimizing fraudulent transactions.

### SQL Joins and Aggregation
This project extensively utilized SQL joins to integrate data from multiple tables. Using aggregation functions, I generated metrics such as total sales, customer counts, average payments, and rental frequencies.

### Reporting and Insights
I created a set of SQL queries to produce summary reports on sales by category, top customers by rental volume, and high-value inventory items.

## Project Outcomes
The final analysis provided Maven Movies management with:
- A clearer understanding of customer behavior and rental trends.
- Actionable insights into inventory management, highlighting popular films and rental durations.
- Enhanced understanding of financial transactions to inform future fraud prevention strategies.
